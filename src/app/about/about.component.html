    ">Front-End</h1>
    <p>In the realm of frontend development, my proficiency extends to leveraging Angular and Tailwind CSS to engineer dynamic and visually appealing web applications. Angular provides a robust framework that facilitates the creation of scalable and maintainable single-page applications, allowing for the seamless integration of complex features and data-binding capabilities. Complementing this, Tailwind CSS serves as a powerful utility-first CSS framework, enabling me to rapidly style and customize the user interface with a diverse set of pre-built classes. This combination ensures that the frontend of my projects not only boasts a high level of functionality but also exhibits a polished and modern aesthetic. My commitment to detail and user-centric design principles remains unwavering, ensuring that the applications I develop are not only visually stunning but also prioritize accessibility and responsiveness for an optimal user experience.</p>
<h1 class="text-2xl flex justify-start mb-1">Back-End</h1>
<P>To fortify the backend infrastructure of my web applications, I employ NestJS in conjunction with PostgreSQL. NestJS, being a powerful and modular TypeScript framework, enables the development of scalable server-side applications with an emphasis on maintainability and organization. Its use of decorators, dependency injection, and a modular architecture aligns seamlessly with my commitment to creating robust and well-structured backend systems. PostgreSQL serves as the relational database management system of choice, offering reliability and efficiency in handling complex data structures. Leveraging the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) capabilities of NestJS, I integrate with PostgreSQL to manage data persistence and retrieval, ensuring seamless interactions between the frontend and backend. This combination allows for the creation of high-performance APIs and robust backend logic, ensuring that the entire application functions harmoniously to deliver a comprehensive and efficient web solution.</P>
